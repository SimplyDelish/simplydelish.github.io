# About Simply Delish 
 
![Simply Delish Logo](images/About.png)

Simply Delish is an application that resolves the problem of there being many food choices on campus. This app allows you to know what specific menu items will be available today at campus center locations, and as well as tell what food is available at the moment. It can also tailor to the style of food you love and let you know when it is available.

Our goal at Simply Delish is to create a tool for Manoa students that will ease thier journey into finding their next delicious meal on campus.

# Development History

Progress on the Simply Delish is divided into four milestones. Each milestone is a progression in the development process.

## Milestone 1: Create Visual Mockups for Pages

The goal of this milestone was to determine the general direction of the project as well as determine what pages are needed and how they will all interact with each other at an abstract level.
